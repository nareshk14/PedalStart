# PedalStart
I've created a Simple Task Management Application for the Assignment given by the Company PedalStart.
Attached files are the codes in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've enabled the VS code Live server for running the Assignment.
In this Assignment, you can create, update and delete tasks. We can also tick the tasks that have been completed.
Click the cicle box alongside the task to mark it as "completed".
