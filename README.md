# PedalStart

I've created a Simple Task Management Application for the Assignment given by the Company PedalStart.

Attached files are the codes in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In order to run it, copy the codes from my repository and paste it in VS Code. Also include the images folder before running the code. The Assignment then can be runned in Live Server of VS Code.

In this Assignment, you can create, update and delete tasks. We can also tick the tasks that have been completed.

Click the cicle box alongside the task to mark it as "completed".

Thank You!
